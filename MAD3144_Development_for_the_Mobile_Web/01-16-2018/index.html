		A paragraph is a group of sentences that convey an idea. Each sentence works together
		as part of a unit to create an overall thought or impression. A paragraph is the smallest
		unit or cluster of sentences in which one idea can be developed adequately. Paragraphs
		can stand alone or function as part of an essay, but each paragraph covers only one main
		idea.
		The most important sentence in your paragraph is the topic sentence, which clearly
		states the subject of the whole paragraph. The topic sentence is usually the first
		sentence of the paragraph because it gives an overview of the sentences to follow. The
		supporting sentences after the topic sentence help to develop the main idea. These
		sentences give specific details related to the topic sentence. A final or concluding
		sentence often restates or summarizes the main idea of the topic sentence.
